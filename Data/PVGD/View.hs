This module defines the generic view.

The T type represents type applications with any number of arguments. It
trivially includes occurrences of non-parameters. I'm not yet distinguishing
recursive from non-recursive type occurrences, but I think that'd be
admissible.

We unfortunately cannot express the relationship between k and the length of ps
in the Rep family and Generic class. This would inhibit type inference, were it
not for the pervasive NLong constraints on the Generic methods. Because they're
on those methods, they unfortunately need to be on all classes' methods. But it
otherwise appears from the user's perspective as a simulation of a promoted
Vec.

In the Data.Yoko.BasicTypes file, the instances of NLong can be replaced with
the informationless totally parametric instance in order to see how NLong's
role in type inference. When NLong is thusly made trivial, this module no
longer type checks. The errors are variations on this theme:

  *Data.PVGD.View> -- with the meaningless NLong instance:
  *Data.PVGD.View> :t asW1 $ \x -> frRep (toRep x)
  asW1 $ \x -> frRep (toRep x)
    :: (Generic (* -> *) t1, Generic (* -> *) t2,
        Rep (* -> *) t1 ~ Rep (* -> *) t2) =>
       t2 t -> t1 t

  *Data.PVGD.View> -- with the meaningless NLong instance:
  *Data.PVGD.View> :t asW1 $ \x -> frRep (toRep x)
  asW1 $ \x -> frRep (toRep x)
    :: (Generic (* -> *) t, Generic (* -> *) t1,
        Rep (* -> *) t ~ Rep (* -> *) t1) =>
       t1 (Nth * 'Z ps) -> t (Nth * 'Z ps)

The key point is that the length of ps cannot be inferred from the kind of t
without the NLong constraints. If Vec could be promoted, this would be built
into the types of toRep and frRep.

Even with the NLong constraints, I cannot use more strongly typed versions of
unW0, unW1, unW2, ... GHC 7.6 is for some reason not reducing the NLong
constraints when type-checking the Generic instances. Similarly, the W
instances cannot be GADT-like wrt to the ps parameter. Thus, I use the Nth
family to access the type list "non strictly".
